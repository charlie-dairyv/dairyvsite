        <h1>Welcome to Our World: MILK</h1>
        
        <p>Milk, that most natural and nutritious of beverages, gifted to us by nature – whether it be from cows, goats, sheep or any other domesticated species (Yes, camels and yak’s too).  That liquid nutrition which we enjoy as fresh milk, add different flavors to (chocolate and strawberry are the favorites), or use to make so many fantastic dairy products such as cheeses, yogurts, cream cheese and a multitude of others. </p>
        
        <p>Our Mission is to change how milk is consumed around the world, starting in our own back yard. We want milk to be available in many new places and forms, all the time being safe, nutritious and sustainable. </p>
        
        <h2>What are we?</h2>
        
        <p>We are a new Dairy Technology Company based in Wisconsin. We have developed a  unique processing technology that we believe will change the way we consume fresh milk, how we transport milk and how we use milk as an ingredient in food products. We’re excited. We’re committed. Please explore our website to learn more about us, our technology and how we are developing this opportunity. </p>
        
        <p>The dairy industry isn&#39;t just my life&#39;s work, it&#39;s my passion!</p>
        
        <p>Dr. Charles Sizer, Founder</p>
