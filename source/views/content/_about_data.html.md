#ABOUT US

##OUR STORY

It all started with Dr. Charles Sizer.

Dr. Charles Sizer, or Chuck as we know him, is an innovator. Following a lengthy career working in Research and Development for a number of international food corporations, including Frito-lay, Tetra Pak and the National Center for Food Safety and Technology, and after amassing over 60 patents by the peak of his profession, he decided it was time for a change. He wanted to do something different. Something that would help create new markets for milk, help the nutritional benefits of dairy become more accessible to consumers and help the industry become more innovative and sustainable in what is a rapidly changing world. 

He created the SEVENx™ process, began the patenting process and then in 2012, after the first patents were granted, created Dairyvative™ Technologies to commercialize his technology. 

We’re making progress. Now with a fully registered pilot plant, 7 employees and very soon our first processor partner, the project is nearing commercialization. We’re excited. We’re motivated. And we’re going to make it happen.
