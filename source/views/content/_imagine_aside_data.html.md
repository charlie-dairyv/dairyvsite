#Our Tech Center

An important part of commercializing new technologies such the SEVENx™ process, is the ability to work on the equipment, to make products for sampling, to really understand what we have in a nuts and bolts way. 

To that end we have invested in a state-of-the-art pilot plant, located in Wisconsin, which is fully licensed to produce dairy products. It’s equipped with all the equipment necessary, including the specialized evaporation and packaging equipment, to produce samples for testing by our customers as well as show our technology in operation. 

It’s a focus of our organization; critical to driving innovation.
