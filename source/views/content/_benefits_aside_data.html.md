#Why is it Sweeter?

Sugar sweetness is commonly measured on a relative scale that scores sucrose, or sugar, as 100. Lactose scores a low 16, whilst its constituent sugars, glucose and galactose, score 74 and 60 respectively. When you convert lactose into glucose and galactose the mixture has a score of about 65, sweeter than the lactose score of 16.
