#BENEFITS OF SEVENx™ PROCESS TECHNOLOGY


Why super-concentrate milk using the SEVENx™ process? 

**Taste Matters**:  What we consume must taste good, or it will fail.  And there are lots of examples of that! It’s key that our SEVENx™ process retains the natural fresh taste of milk with one small difference, it is just a little bit sweeter. (see below: Why it’s sweeter?) 

**Shelf Stable**: Fresh milk is refrigerated to preserve its flavor and keep it from spoiling. Our process achieves both of these with a shelf life at ambient (room) temperature of 6 months. This will open up new possibilities for beverages etc.

**Lactose-Free:** Natural milk sugar, lactose, is made up of two monosaccharides: glucose and galactose. As part of our process we convert the lactose into its constituent sugars, the same as in fresh lactose-free milks sold in stores.  So our lactose-free milk can be enjoyed by the 75% of the population that has trouble digesting lactose, known as lactose intolerance. 

**Low Investments:** One would think that the cost to make this product is high and that it requires a large investment in high tech equipment. Not so. Much of the equipment is common and many dairy processors already have this in place. The investment is relatively low.

**Sustainability:** No refrigeration means less energy needed for storage, a longer shelf life means (much) less product spoilage and returns, and because it is super-concentrated, there is less transport and storage need. The SEVENx™ process has great environmental benefit.
