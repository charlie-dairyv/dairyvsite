#SUSTAINABILITY

The SEVENx™ process provides environmental benefits that are immediately obvious: 

##Refrigeration:

  We don’t need it. Traditional dairy products require refrigeration from the point of production to the point of consumption. The SEVENx™ products are stable at room temperature, so there are huge savings in energy throughout distribution chain, from production all the way to consumption by consumers.

##Transportation: 

  Let’s start with volume. Our SEVENx™ process concentrates the product so that whenever we ship it anywhere, we need one truck instead of seven.  And don’t forget, no refrigeration required on the truck either.

##Packaging: 

  We ship the SEVENx™ super-concentrate in bags, anything from 5 gallons to 20 tonnes per bag (yes, it’s a really big bag; it fills a shipping container). That’s a huge saving in packaging (84% less is an estimate) when you consider each gallon of super-concentrate has about 90 servings of lactose free milk when the water is added back!

##Processing: 

  We save energy when compared to product that is dried such as milk powder.  Also, when we concentrate the product, we are removing water – which we carefully collect, and reuse for cleaning and other duties.

##Milk Supply:

  We work with our processing partners to ensure a safe and sustainable milk supply from dairy farms that have high standards of animal care.
