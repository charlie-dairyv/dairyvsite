It’s incredibly exciting learning and evaluating all the possibilities of what the SEVENx™ process technology can bring to the dairy industry. Here are a few areas we are active, with more to come!

##Milk, the Beverage

Liquid milk sales are just not that exciting: They decline by up to 2% a year and have dropped 30% over the last ten years. Why? Many reasons but among them a huge number of competing milks, from soy to almond to flax and beyond, exciting new functional drinks such as smoothies, and milk’s inability to be conveniently available where the customer wants to buy them. It’s a challenge, because milk’s nutrition has them all beat, and its sales should be growing! 

Let’s look at quick service restaurants (known as QSR’s). At these establishments, milk is usually held behind the counter in a refrigerator. If it’s actually in code and the customer remembers to ask for it, it might sell. How can it compete with those other beverages all readily available at the beverage dispenser? No wonder it doesn’t sell. 

Our SEVENx™ process technology allows the serving of fresh milk beverages from a beverage dispenser, with flavors left to your imagination. No refrigeration needed, no out-of-code product, more than 300 eight fluid ounce servings from one 5-gallon super-concentrate bag. Easy. Innovative. Healthy. 


##Bulk Milk Shipment: 

Milk flows, both nationally and globally from areas of high production to areas where it is consumed. It’s shipped by tanker (fresh milk), by heating and aseptically packaging it (UHT milk), as well as by spray drying it (milk powders). 

The SEVENx process allows us to ship and store milk in large quantities. It doesn’t require refrigeration and because it is a super-concentrate, only requires one truck where before we needed seven.  

We can now ship product across the country to where it is needed at a fraction of the price and with huge sustainability benefits. As an export, we can ship super-concentrate around the globe where it can be reconstituted to milk or used to make dairy products such as yogurt. Sustainable. Exciting. Healthy. 

##Milk, the Ingredient: 

Dairy ingredients historically have been a way to use up excess milk. You simply dried it and sold it to someone who used it as an ingredient in a food or beverage. This has evolved and is now a $19 billion global industry.  Most global dairy companies today have specialized divisions that focus on the development and delivery of milk ingredients. 

Dry milk ingredients taste, well, like they come from dry milk ingredients! Powder taste is the technical term that is often used. The SEVENx™ process gives industry an alternative that tastes like fresh milk, is shelf stable and is easy to use. 

We don’t see ourselves competing directly against the massive scale of dry milk powder ingredients – we’re content to find those opportunities where the taste and freshness is a premium. Where they realize the benefit of being lactose free.
