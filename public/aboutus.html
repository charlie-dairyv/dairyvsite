          <h1>Company</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Dairyvative Technologies</strong>
            , is a Wisconsin based dairy business with patented SEVENx technology for concentrating milk. The basis of our business is licensing and servicing the sustainable Sevenx process technology.
          </p>
          <p>The SEVENx technology was developed by Dr. Charles Sizer to help dairy processors and manufacturers meet a growing demand for higher-quality milk and dairy products that are sustainably produced and more accessible here and throughout the world.  Dr. Sizer’s vision was to develop a concentrated milk product that could ship unrefrigerated in bulk containers.  He believed that processes could be developed that would result in a lactose-free milk which would retain the delightful flavor and quality of fresh milk when reconstituted. Dairyvative Technologies was founded in 2012 after the first products were produced and the initial patents were granted.</p>
          <p>Dr. Sizer, a world expert on aseptic technologies, has dedicated his career to food safety and the development of more efficient fluid food processes and packaging systems.  He has over 60 patents granted worldwide. Dr. Sizer is committed to sustainable practices that reduce the environmental impact of delivering food from farm to table worldwide.</p>
          <h1>Vision</h1>
          <p>Our vision is to enable worldwide supply of fresh milk.  We are focused on improving the global consumer experience by delivering a fresh quality, lactose-free product while furthering efficient use of earth’s resources through the development of green dairy technology. To that end, we are committed to sustainable growth of the dairy industry and the development of new opportunities and markets for dairy farmers and cooperatives.</p>
          <p>Dairyvative is dedicated to high ethical standards.  We believe in providing an environment where each person is recognized for the difference he or she makes providing an environment where employees can flourish.</p>
