            SEVENx Technology can make a significant impact on the carbon footprint of the dairy industry. The SEVENx process utilizes low temperatures and requires less energy for manufacture, reduces the amount of packaging, eliminates the need for refrigerated distribution and storage, and reduces shipping by 84%.  With the reduced cost of shipping, it becomes feasible to locate dairy herds away from population centers where the herds can graze, further reducing the carbon footprint compared to cows that are grain fed.

          <h1>Life Cycle</h1>

            completed a comprehensive life cycle analysis of the carbon footprint of milk in 2012 to quantify the amount of greenhouse gases generated in producing 1 kilogram of milk. They determined that 2.05 kilograms of CO2 equivalents are required to deliver one kilogram of milk from the processing plant to the consumer, using all of the current distribution platforms. The report called on the dairy industry overall to “create more sustainability initiatives.”
          </p>
          <p>SEVENx uses state-of-the-art technology to efficiently remove the water with evaporators using mechanical vapor recompression (MVR). MVR recycles the steam allowing it to be re-used 200 times. This results in enormous energy savings and a product that is 7-9x (v/v) in concentrate. As a result, this milk concentration process uses only a fraction of the resources required for any other type of milk concentrate.</p>
          <p>The life cycle analysis report compiled by the Innovation Center for US Dairy concluded that present technology was already doing an excellent job of delivering milk products to the consumer. SEVENx technology offers the dairy industry the opportunity to further reduce green house gas emissions on long hauls by 84% simply by reducing the number of tankers seven fold. This does not account for reduced wear and tear on roads.</p>
          <p>The standard contemporary dairy produces more than 500% of the greenhouse gases than would a dairy using SEVENx technology to concentrate milk on the farm.  A farm with roughly 3000 cows would reduce the weekly number of milk tanker shipments from 36 to 6.  The SEVENx process in addition would return 40% of the water needs back to the farm.</p>
          <p>A complete conversion of the dairy industry to SEVENx technology could reduce the carbon footprint of milk from 2.05 kilograms down to roughly 0.4 of a kilogram.</p>
