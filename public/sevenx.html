          <h1>LEADERSHIP</h1>
          <p>Dr. Charles E Sizer, III is a internationally recognized food scientist with expertise in fluid food processing and packaging systems. A seventeen-year veteran of Tetra Pak, his efforts in the design of product and packaging sterilization processes resulted in 15 US patents and over 60 patents granted worldwide. As Director of the National Center for Food Safety and Technology at Illinois Institute of Technology, he was at the forefront of cutting-edge research and technical programs.</p>
          <p>Dr. Sizer has held substantial professional positions and affiliations with the National Science Foundation, National Food Processors Association, Food Processor’s Institute, Institute of Food Technology, Dairy and Food Industry Suppliers Association, Editorial Board of the Journal of Packaging Technology, and the Institute of Thermal Processing Specialists, Dr. Sizer has recently received the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Director’s Special Citation Award, and the Chicago Section of the Institute of Food Technologists Achievement Award for Outstanding Achievement in Food Science.</p>
          <p>To further illustrate his achievements: Dr. Sizer has been awarded 33 research grants; he has been published 110 times with various articles, trade publications, professional presentations; and Dr. Sizer holds 14 patents relating to food product processing and packaging techniques.</p>
          <h2>SEVENX</h2>
          <p>The SEVEN-X process is a novel, patented technology that allows pasteurized milk to be concentrated to a liquid that has one seventh its original volume. SEVEN-X removes 95% of the original water yielding a 5.8x mass concentration that has 85% less volume than the raw milk. The technology effectively reduces the volume of seven tankers of milk into one container of concentrate.</p>
          <p>SEVEN-X uses lactase enzyme to hydrolyze the lactose into glucose and galactose. This step simultaneously prevents the lactose from crystallizing while reducing the water activity (the measure of the availability of water) to less than .88, preventing microbial growth. The end product is uniquely lactose-free and shelf-stable without refrigeration for up to one year at ambient temperatures. The highly sustainable process uses moderate temperatures that are gentle enough to leave milk proteins intact; the reconstituted product has the pleasant flavor of fresh milk.</p>
          <h2>DAIRYVATIVE PILOT CENTER</h2>
          <h1>Equipment</h1>
          <p>Dairyvative Technologies’ pilot center, located at The Wisconsin Center for Dairy Research (CDR), is equipped with an evaporation unit designed to produce concentrated milk using the SEVEN-X process. Through the cooperation of the CDR, The plant has easy access to dry and refrigerated storage.  Conveniently located is a loading bay with a forklift for semi-trailer delivery of equipment and supplies directly to the dairy plant. Complete laboratory facilities for food quality analysis are available through the CDR or the University of Wisconsin Babcock Hall Dairy plant.</p>
          <p>The pilot center is a focal point for further developing the SEVEN-X technology; growing opportunities and new innovation.  We are working with the industry to accelerate SEVEN-X technology commercialization and adoption through hands-on experience and application.  The center offers opportunity to innovate and test novel dairy applications.</p>
          <p>Dairyvative Technologies Commitment to Dairy Industry growth will be our legacy; expanding the reach of the dairy farmer and their cooperatives to distant markets. Today, we are working together to provide world access to nutritious, responsibly produced fresh milk and more sustainable novel dairy based products for the 21st century and beyond.</p>
          <p>Dairyvative Technologies Sustainability process across the supply chain,</p>
          will focus on cost savings and business value that can spur continuous improvement in many areas, including processing and packaging, bulk unrefrigerated transportation, distribution and warehousing and unrefrigerated retail display.
          <h2>The Wisconsin Center for Dairy Research</h2>
          <p>Dairyvative Technologies is proud to locate the Dairyvative Pilot Center and The Wisconsin Center for Dairy Research (CDR), premier dairy research center located on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus.  The CDR is located within a licensed, operating dairy plant.</p>
