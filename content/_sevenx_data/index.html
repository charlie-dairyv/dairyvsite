    <h1>SEVENx™</h1>
    
    <p>Our technology, which we call the SEVENx™ process, allows us to remove enough water from gently pasteurized fresh milk to make a super-concentrated milk that does not need refrigeration and when the water is added back, tastes like fresh milk.</p>
    
    <h2>What’s different?</h2>
    
    <p>Old technology only goes so far. When concentrating fresh milk, current water removal technologies such as evaporation, can remove up to 80% of the water (known as a 4X concentration) at which point the milk sugar (lactose) crystallizes and the product essentially becomes unworkable. As a concentrate it’s highly susceptible to bacterial spoilage, needs refrigeration and has a relatively short shelf life. </p>
    
    <p>The SEVENx™ process allows us to remove up to 95% of the water (known as a 7X concentration, that’s where the seven in SEVENx™ comes from) to produce a milk concentrate that is honey-like, can be pumped, packaged and reconstituted.  At the end of the SEVENx™ process our concentrated milk:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Tastes the same as fresh milk when reconstituted</li>
    <li>Does not need refrigeration (is shelf stable)</li>
    <li>Has a shelf life of at least 6 months</li>
    <li>Is lactose free</li>
    <li>Only about 17% of its original milk volume</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>*It sweeter because it is lactose free</p>
    
    <h2>How do we do this?</h2>
    
    <p>At a specific point during the milk concentration process we stop the evaporation process and hydrolyze the lactose into its constituent sugars, glucose and galactose, the same process that happens during digestion.  After this, we complete the concentration process using our specialized patented SEVENx™ evaporation technology, which removes up to 95% of the water, all the while maintaining the product as thick syrup that can be easily pumped.  This super-concentrated milk now has the water content reduced to the point that the growth of spoilage bacteria is stopped. It is packaged aseptically to create a shelf stable product ready for shipment.</p>
