    <h1>SUSTAINABILITY</h1>
    
    <p>The SEVENx™ process provides environmental benefits that are immediately obvious: </p>
    
    <h2>Refrigeration:</h2>
    
    <p>We don’t need it. Traditional dairy products require refrigeration from the point of production to the point of consumption. The SEVENx™ products are stable at room temperature, so there are huge savings in energy throughout distribution chain, from production all the way to consumption by consumers.</p>
    
    <h2>Transportation:</h2>
    
    <p>Let’s start with volume. Our SEVENx™ process concentrates the product so that whenever we ship it anywhere, we need one truck instead of seven.  And don’t forget, no refrigeration required on the truck either.</p>
    
    <h2>Packaging:</h2>
    
    <p>We ship the SEVENx™ super-concentrate in bags, anything from 5 gallons to 20 tonnes per bag (yes, it’s a really big bag; it fills a shipping container). That’s a huge saving in packaging (84% less is an estimate) when you consider each gallon of super-concentrate has about 90 servings of lactose free milk when the water is added back!</p>
    
    <h2>Processing:</h2>
    
    <p>We save energy when compared to product that is dried such as milk powder.  Also, when we concentrate the product, we are removing water – which we carefully collect, and reuse for cleaning and other duties.</p>
    
    <h2>Milk Supply:</h2>
    
    <p>We work with our processing partners to ensure a safe and sustainable milk supply from dairy farms that have high standards of animal care.
