    <h1>BENEFITS OF SEVENx™ PROCESS TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    
    <p>Why super-concentrate milk using the SEVENx™ process? </p>
    
    <p><strong>Taste Matters</strong>:  What we consume must taste good, or it will fail.  And there are lots of examples of that! It’s key that our SEVENx™ process retains the natural fresh taste of milk with one small difference, it is just a little bit sweeter. (see below: Why it’s sweeter?) </p>
    
    <p><strong>Shelf Stable</strong>: Fresh milk is refrigerated to preserve its flavor and keep it from spoiling. Our process achieves both of these with a shelf life at ambient (room) temperature of 6 months. This will open up new possibilities for beverages etc.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Lactose-Free:</strong> Natural milk sugar, lactose, is made up of two monosaccharides: glucose and galactose. As part of our process we convert the lactose into its constituent sugars, the same as in fresh lactose-free milks sold in stores.  So our lactose-free milk can be enjoyed by the 75% of the population that has trouble digesting lactose, known as lactose intolerance. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Low Investments:</strong> One would think that the cost to make this product is high and that it requires a large investment in high tech equipment. Not so. Much of the equipment is common and many dairy processors already have this in place. The investment is relatively low.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong> No refrigeration means less energy needed for storage, a longer shelf life means (much) less product spoilage and returns, and because it is super-concentrated, there is less transport and storage need. The SEVENx™ process has great environmental benefit. </p>
